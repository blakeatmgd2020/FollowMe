First Swift Project

In this project I am following the tutorial found in the book 'Swift for Beginners: Develop and Design, Second Edition', in Chapter 9: Going Mobile with Swift. The original code used here was transcribed directly out of the book from pages 231-235. However, given the many updates to  Swift, Xcode, and iOS between the time this book was published in 2016 and my rewriting of the program in December of 2021, I have had to make many modifications to the original code for it to work on current platforms.
